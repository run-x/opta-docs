## What is Opta?

Opta is an Infrastructure-As-Code framework where you work with high-level constructs instead of getting lost
in low level cloud configuration. Opta gives you a vast library of modules that you can connect together to
build your ideal Infrastructure stack. Best of all, Opta uses Terraform under the hood - so you're never locked in.
You can always write custom Terraform or even take the Opta generated Terraform and go your own way!

## Why use Opta
Infrastructure as code (IaC) has rapidly become the standard for provisioning and managing Infrastructure and 
for the right reasons! But the leading IaC tools are still complicated to use and require deep Cloud/Infrastructure
expertise. Opta was conceptualized to help address this complexity. Opta is a simpler IaC framework with best practices
built-in. It enables users to set up automated, scalable and secure infrastructure without being a cloud expert or 
spending days figuring out cloud minutiae!

We are confident it can drastically reduce the cloud complexity and devops headaches of most fast moving 
organizations. It is already being used by companies - big and small :)
