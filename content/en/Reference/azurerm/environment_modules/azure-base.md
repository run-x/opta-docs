description: Sets up virtual network, private subnet, security groups (and their rules), default encryption key vault, and the container registry
---

This module is the "base" module for creating an environment in azure. It sets up the virtual network, private subnet,
security groups (and their rules), default encryption key vault, and the container registry. Defaults are set to work
99% of the time, assuming no funny networking constraints (you'll know them if you have them), so
_no need to set any of the fields or know what the outputs do_.

## Fields


| Name      | Description | Default | Required |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- |
| `private_ipv4_cidr_block` | Cidr block for the whole vpc. | `10.0.0.0/16` | False |
| `subnet_ipv4_cidr_block` | Cidr block for private subnet. Don't need to worry about AZs in Azure | `10.0.0.0/17` | False |

## Outputs


| Name      | Description |
